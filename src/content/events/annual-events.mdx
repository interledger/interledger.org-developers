Each year we host an [Interledger Summit](https://interledger.org/summit) to bring together innovators, developers, and thought leaders to share knowledge and shape the future of payments. We also organize a [hackathon](https://interledger.org/summit/hackathon), offering hands-on opportunities to explore and build with Interledger technologies. Every October, we proudly participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://interledger.org/hacktoberfest), supporting open source contributions and fostering collaboration worldwide. Join us at these events to connect, learn, and make an impact!
