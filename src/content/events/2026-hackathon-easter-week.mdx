A hackathon is a time-bound, collaborative event where people with diverse skills (coders, designers, experts) team up intensely to rapidly develop innovative solutions, prototypes, or products, often around a specific theme like tech or a business problem, culminating in presentations to solve challenges and foster creativity, skill-building, and networking. It's a creative marathon combining "hack" (creative problem-solving) and "marathon," usually lasting 24-48 hours to a few days, pushing participants to build something functional quickly.  ![image.png](https://strapi-admin.interledger.org/uploads/image_eaaa7ebd35.png)
