The Interledger community calls take place once a month, on the second Wednesday of each month. We invite you to share any demos, updates or milestones of your projects that build on the Interledger protocol. It’s also a great place for new members of the community to find out first hand more about Interledger and how you can get involved. 

Please join us on [**Google Meet**](https://meet.google.com/) using code: `enb-ayiv-rnw`

Time: 10:00 AM CDT / 3:00 PM UTC.
