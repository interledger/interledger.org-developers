After shaking off the January blues, the Interledger Engineering Managers and Product Managers gathered with the BreakPoint IT team for a productive work week in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
Why did we do this? It's crucial to reflect on the achievements of the past year, set goals and expectations for the year ahead, and, of course, meet face-to-face to finally enjoy that coffee we've been talking about.

The plan for the week was straightforward: review all the projects that the BreakPoint IT team is working on, present the latest developments, discuss ongoing work, and outline the direction of these projects in the coming months.
The projects covered included the [Open Payments](https://openpayments.dev/)/[Rafiki](https://rafiki.dev/) integration projects, our Test Network - [Test Wallet](https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/), [Test Boutique](https://boutique.interledger-test.dev/), [Interledger Pay](https://interledgerpay.com/), and [Interledger Cards](https://wallet.interledger.cards/).

We also highlighted our goal of expanding Open Payment SDKs across multiple programming languages. While our TypeScript SDK is ready, we're also working on PHP, Rust, Go, and Python SDKs with the support of our developers and the community, and we're aiming to add Java and mobile SDKs as well.
Rafiki updates and goals were also discussed, with more detailed conversations expected during the Rafiki work week later this year.

Two of the most talked-about topics were the [Web Monetization Extension](https://webmonetization.org/) and the Publisher Tools.
The progress these products are making, week by week, is a testament to the incredible people behind them. There are exciting plans ahead for these projects, so stay tuned.

As always, plans are set, but sometimes a team or two must shift focus to tackle something urgent or higher priority, and they’re sent into the "dungeon" to make it happen.
This year, the fortunate team was the Interledger Wallet team. The [Interledger Wallet](https://interledger.app/) is currently under development, with Interledger taking over the old Fynbos wallet and giving it a complete revamp, along with new features.
Remember the new cards we were all excited about after the [Interledger Summit 2024](https://interledger.org/summit)?
The Interledger Wallet team will be the ones to bring the new cards vision to life.

We also had the chance to discuss ways the team can improve community involvement.
Speaking of which, Ioana, our Community-focused Engineering Manager, organized an incredible event in collaboration with [Women in Tech](https://www.womenintechcluj.com/)—a meetup focused on Web Monetization, titled Pay the Web Forward.
After listening to insightful presentations and demos by [Ioana Chiorean](https://interledger.org/team/ioana-chiorean), [Rabeb Othmani](https://interledger.org/team/rabeb-othmani), and [Timea Nagy](https://interledger.org/team/timea-nagy), the participants had numerous questions, and the level of engagement was impressive.
The networking session even ran longer than expected, reflecting the strong interest and enthusiasm.

In summary, the BreakPoint Work Week was both productive and successful. Decisions were made, discussions took place, coffees were enjoyed, and Romanian sweets were consumed in abundance.
The consensus was clear: we’re all looking forward to the next time we meet up again.

Bonus picture, Romanian Floating Island dessert, AKA Birds Milk, if you haven’t tried it yet, we highly recommend it.
