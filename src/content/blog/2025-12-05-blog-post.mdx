## Website editor requirements and sore points

### Chiara

*   manages a lot of blogs
*   last minute updates, like a grant - right now, no capability to update a link, date, content
*   Grantee database - updateable by Editors / Chiara
*   The events page should be updateable and manageable by Chiara https://interledger.org/events  - right now it's 100% static.
*   Press / Media page - very very outdated - [https://interledger.org/press](https://interledger.org/press)

Her words were echoed by Rafael Odreman, Head of Strategic Partnerships at Finnosummit, who emphasized the broader impact:

>  _“We saw the Interledger Protocol move from a technical concept to a practical tool for financial inclusion. We can build a payments system where sending money is as simple and inexpensive as sending an email, breaking barriers that currently exclude millions of Mexicans and Latin Americans.”_

Together, these perspectives highlight the hackathon’s role in shifting open payments from theory into practice.
