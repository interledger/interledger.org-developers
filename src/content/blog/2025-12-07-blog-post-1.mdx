On November 8 & 9, 2025, more than 170 developers, students, designers, and entrepreneurs gathered at InSpark in Mexico City for the Interledger Hackathon. Over 24 hours, 47 teams worked side by side to turn the promise of interoperable payments into working prototypes.

The challenge was clear: how can open-source tools like the [Interledger Protocol (ILP)](https://interledger.org/interledger) and [Open Payments API](https://openpayments.dev/overview/getting-started/) help reduce cash dependency, lower remittance costs, and improve digital acceptance for small businesses?
