## Why Open Payments in Go?

The [**Open Payments**](https://openpayments.dev/) standard is reshaping how applications initiate, manage, and complete digital transactions — enabling truly interoperable financial systems across different wallets, services, and financial institutions.

The Interledger Foundation has been steadily expanding SDK support across languages — [Node](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-node) led the way, followed by [PHP](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-php) and [Rust](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-rust). But one language was notably missing: **Go**.

According to the [2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology#worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-language-worked-want), Go ranks among the top backend languages, sitting alongside TypeScript and Python in developer adoption. Perhaps more tellingly, the survey notes that “Python developers aspire to use Rust and Go as the path to high-performance systems programming” — reflecting Go’s growing role in cloud infrastructure, microservices, and performance-critical backends.

Today, we’re excited to close that gap with [**Open Payments Go**](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-go) — an open-source SDK that brings first-class Open Payments support to the Go ecosystem.

## What We Built

[interledger/open-payments-go](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-go) is a production-ready Go module that provides complete client support for the Open Payments API.

It includes:

*   Complete API coverage — wallet addresses, grants, tokens, quotes, incoming payments, and outgoing payments.
*   Built for Go 1.21+, leveraging Go’s strong typing, interfaces, and standard library conventions.
*   **Types generated directly from OpenAPI specifications** using [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen), ensuring the SDK stays in sync with the Open Payments spec.
*   Built-in HTTP signature utilities for [GNAP authentication](https://openpayments.dev/identity/http-signatures/), abstracting away the complexity of Ed25519 signing.
*   Comprehensive integration tests against both local Rafiki environments and the test wallet.

Here’s what it looks like to request a grant and create an incoming payment:![54920527757\_21a59969ac\_k.jpg](https://strapi-admin.interledger.org/uploads/54920527757_21a59969ac_k_73c9248e63.jpg)
