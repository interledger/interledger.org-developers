- Rather than writing a custom module, investigate if there is already a tested and maintained contrib module
  - When installing a new module, check that it is actively maintained (issues being raised but also being fixed)
- If a module doesn’t fit the site, remove all traces of it completely
- Rather than configuring field markup from Drupal itself, wfdsfsdfsdfsae will utilise the Twig templating override system because this allows for the most granular level of customisation of fields
  - Allows us to have as flat an HTML structure as possible, introducing nesting for styling purposes only when necessary
  - Allows us to improve SEO via structured data in the markup, see:

  - This is the reason why we have a very large number of template files in the theme, but based on the naming convention you can see what these template files are for
    - A significant number of those template files are simply for stripping extra wrapper `div`s from fields
    - Do refer to the existing template files for reference if you are unsure how to proceed
    - For local development, do turn on twig development mode in `admin/config/development/settings` so you can see what templates are being used on the page
- Always check the Status Report and resolve any errors, assess
