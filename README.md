# Interledger developer portal

Source code for the /developer-tools portion of [Interledger.org](https://interledger.org/). This site is separate from the headless Drupal-powered main site and is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), a documentation framework powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── cms/                    # Strapi CMS for content management
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   ├── blog/          # Blog posts (MDX files generated by CMS)
│   │   └── press/         # Press content (MDX files generated by CMS)
│   ├── content.config.ts
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── blog/          # Blog listing and individual post pages
│   │   ├── index.astro
│   │   └── press.astro    # Press page
│   ├── styles/
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Static assets, like favicons or images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. When referencing these assets in your markdown, you do not have to include `public/` in the file path, so an image would have a path like:

```md
![A lovely description of your beautiful image](/img/YOUR_BEAUTIFUL_IMAGE.png)
```

For more information about the way our documentation projects are set up, please refer to our [documentation style guide](https://interledger.tech/#docs-site-building).

### Running the CMS

```bash
cd cms
npm install  # If not already installed
npm run develop
```

The Strapi admin panel will be available at: <http://localhost:1337/admin>

For detailed CMS documentation, see [cms/README.md](cms/README.md).

## Local Development

We are using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) in this repository, but you could theoretically use the package manager of your choice. To install Bun, run

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun run start`           | Starts local dev server at `localhost:1103`      |
| `bun run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
| `bun run format`          | Format code and fix linting issues               |
| `bun run lint`            | Check code formatting and linting                |

You can substitute the `bun` commands with whatever package manager of your choice uses.

### 🔍 Code Formatting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your code is properly formatted:

1. **Fix issues**: Run `bun run format` to automatically format code and fix linting issues
2. **Check before pushing**: Run `bun run lint` to verify everything passes (CI will also run this)

ESLint is configured to work with TypeScript and Astro files. The configuration extends recommended rules from ESLint, TypeScript ESLint, and Astro ESLint plugins, and integrates with Prettier to avoid conflicts.

Thank You for Contributing! We appreciate your effort to write a blog post and share your expertise with the community!

## Writing a blog post

**Goal:** Educate, drive adoption, and grow strategic influence.

**Typical Target Audience:**

- Technically-inclined users interested in Interledger development.
- Technically-inclined users interested in financial services technologies, innovations, or developments.
- Users keen on topics like APIs, data analytics, metrics, analysis, and quantitative assessment for digital networks.
- Users interested in privacy and related technologies.

**Possible Content Framework:**

If you're unsure how to structure your writing, you can use this as a guide.

- Introduction / main point
- Context - Interledger’s perspective / stance / commitment on the topic being written [broader categories like privacy, metrics for growth, Digital Financial Inclusion etc.]
- The Challenge (or) The Problem
- The Solution
- The How / implementation
- Roadmap - short-term / long-term
- Note: A call to action (CTA) will be included automatically at the bottom of every post.

Ideal Word Count: Between 1,000 and 2,500 words, with links to relevant documents/pages for a deeper understanding.

### Getting Started

Discuss Ideas: Before starting, share your blog post ideas with the tech team to ensure alignment and awareness.

Copy the Template: Begin your draft using [this Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7vzsYORg9xmf72ljTdmyekpq2vJ7eQZ9atM2uAXgUM/edit?usp=sharing) to maintain a consistent format.

Review Process##

Initial Reviews:

- Once your draft is ready, request specific reviewers or ask for feedback on the #tech-team Slack channel.
- Incorporate feedback and refine the blog post.

Finalizing:

- When the draft is stable, create a pull request in the [interledger.org-developers](https://github.com/interledger/interledger.org-developers) GitHub repo.
- Please add links where appropriate so people can easily click to learn more about the concepts you reference.
- Include all images used in the post in the PR.
- No-one is expected to know the ins and outs of Astro (the framework that powers our site), so please tag Sarah as a reviewer to ensure everything Astro-related is in order.

### Working with Visuals

- If you need an illustration, submit a design request in advance to Madalina via the #design Slack channel using the design request form.
- Before uploading images to GitHub, run them through an image optimizer such as [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
- Ensure images are appropriately sized; feel free to ask Madalina or Sarah for assistance.

### Publishing Your Blog Post

- Remember: merging the pull request will publish the blog post immediately.
- Ensure the publishing date in the blog post metadata matches the intended release date.
- Check with Ioana to confirm the publishing date and keep a consistent posting schedule. Ioana will also handle social media promotion.
- Run `bun run format` and `bun run lint` to format your code and check for issues before creating a pull request.
